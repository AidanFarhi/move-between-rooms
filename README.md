# Move Between Rooms

This game is a simplified text-based adventure game where the player explores different rooms in a dragon-themed setting. 
The player starts in the "Great Hall" and can navigate through rooms using move commands such as "go North," "go East," "go South," or "go West." 
The player can exit the game by entering the "exit" command.
The game provides feedback on the player's actions, validates their commands, and updates the current room accordingly.
